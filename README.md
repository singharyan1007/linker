  An effortlessly simple link sharing app that lets you share all your links though a single page.

![](./src/assets/Linkerdemo.png)

This is a dead simple link sharing application built using **NextJS** and **TailwindCSS**. This project aims to provide a starter template for an SPA to share all your links at one place.

I built it because I wanted a simple application to hold all my links so that I can share it to a potential recruiter or anyone in general easily. It had to be personalised and minimalistic too. 

Well using this as a template can be opiniated. Ostensibly, anyone could use an application like Linktree but creating something of my own felt more in my control. And also avoiding the troubles of sign up and login and tracing of data.
